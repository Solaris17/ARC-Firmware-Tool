# Design Form

## Versioning

Versioning is done as follows:

Major.Minor.Patch

Major versions are based on and upto the GPU generation. For example **_1_**.2.0 would be Intel's first generation GPU; Alchemist.

Minor versions follow tick-tock policy. Even numbers are stable releases, odd numbers are BETA. For example 1.**_2_**.0 would be a stable release.

Patch versions are generally just that though a feature may sneak in; usually in BETA builds.
